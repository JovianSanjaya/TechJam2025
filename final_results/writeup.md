Project Analysis Output Files
The compliance analysis process generates three distinct output files, each tailored for a different purpose:

final.json: This is the most comprehensive and structured output. It serves as the primary data source for programmatic use, such as populating a user interface or feeding into other automated systems. It contains a detailed breakdown of the analysis for each feature, including risk levels, confidence scores, applicable regulations, implementation notes, and extensive metadata about the analysis run itself (e.g., RAG performance, backend services used).

final.csv: This file provides a flattened, tabular summary of the key results. Each row corresponds to a feature, and the columns represent the most critical fields like feature_name, risk_level, confidence, and action_required. Its format is ideal for quick data review, spreadsheet analysis, and generating high-level reports.

final.txt: This is a human-readable text summary of the overall analysis. It presents the most important statistics, such as the total number of features analyzed, the count of high-risk items, and key recommendations in a clear and concise format. This file is perfect for quick, at-a-glance assessments and for stakeholders who need a summary without diving into the technical details.

System Resilience: Fallback to "Pure RAG"
A key design feature of our system is its resilience. This is demonstrated in the analysis of features 26 through 30.

Due to token limitation, the openrouter service became unavailable. In such scenarios, where the primary Large Language Model (LLM) is unavailable, the system gracefully degrades to a "Pure RAG" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode.

In this mode, the analysis relies solely on the information retrieved from our internal knowledge base of legal and compliance documents, without the final synthesis and reasoning step from the LLM. As a result, the system can still identify potential compliance needs and assign a baseline risk, but the confidence scores are noticeably lower (ranging from 0.41 to 0.47), and the recommended action defaults to a more cautious "MONITOR_COMPLIANCE".

Our team intentionally included this behavior to demonstrate that the system remains functional even if the LLM service fails. This ensures that a baseline level of compliance analysis is always performed, preventing a complete failure and highlighting areas that require manual review.
